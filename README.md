# PORFOLIO PROJECT

Developed with React-TailwindCSS for Front-End and NodeJS for Back-End

## Table of Contents

- `Header`: This section features the navigation bar, along with a convenient "Download CV" button for obtaining a PDF copy of my CV.
- `Hero`: A brief introduction to myself, complete with links to my LinkedIn and Github profiles.
- `About`: This section showcases my skills and provides insight into my background.
- `Projects`: Here, you'll find a growing list of projects I've undertaken. Instead of navigating to different pages for each project, they are presented in an expandable card design. Each card provides a glimpse into the project's primary purpose, its technology stack, and links to its Github repository or live product.
- `Contact`: This section is your gateway to reaching out to me and leaving a message. Feel free to get in touch!
